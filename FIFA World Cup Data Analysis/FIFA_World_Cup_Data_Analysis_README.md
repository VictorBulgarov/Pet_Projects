# FIFA World Cup Data Analysis

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores various aspects of the FIFA World Cup through data analysis and visualization. The analysis is based on data from three datasets that contain information about World Cups, the matches played, and the players and coaches involved.

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project are:
1. WorldCups.csv - Contains information about each FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 2014.
2. WorldCupMatches.csv - Contains details of the matches played in FIFA World Cups from 1930 to 2014.
3. WorldCupPlayers.csv - Contains information about the players and coaches of the teams that have played in FIFA World Cups from 1930 to 2014.

## Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook (`FIFA_World_Cup_Analysis.ipynb`) contains Python code (using pandas, matplotlib, and plotly) to analyze and visualize the data from the datasets.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary Python packages by running the following command: 
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells to view the analysis and visualizations.

## Visualizations
The notebook includes the following visualizations:
1. A bar chart of the countries with the most World Cup wins.
2. Bar charts of the top 5 matches with the most goals and highest attendance.

Feel free to explore the data and come up with your own analyses and visualizations!
